# Digital Humanities Learning Journey

Learning Python and computational methods for classical reception studies.
October 2025 - May 2027

## Current Focus
- Python fundamentals (Python for Everybody)
- Text processing for Latin/Greek texts
- Exploring DH project possibilities in classical studies

## Week 1 (Oct 17-23, 2025)
### Day 1 ✅
- Python for Everybody Weeks 1-2
- Built 5 programs (calculator, temp converter, etc.)
- Set up all documentation systems
- Over 3 hours Python learning with some technical issues along the way
### Day 2 ✅ (Oct 19)
- Conditionals (if/elif/else) and boolean logic
- Functions (def, parameters, return values)
- Built 7 programs including interactive temperature converter
- Built limited working Latin declension analyzer
  - Encodes all 5 declensions with 6-case conversion
  - Pattern detection (diphthongs, syllables)
  - Interactive phrase analysis
- **Hours:** 5

### Day 3 ✅ (Oct 19)
- Loops (for, while) and iteration patterns
- Advanced string manipulation (slicing, methods)
- Built 7 programs exploring loops and strings
- Built Latin text frequency analyzer
  - Processes actual Latin passages
  - Counts word frequency
  - Identifies most common words
  - First tool working with corpus text
- **Hours:** 6
- Note: Shorter day due to some personal stuff. Excited for tomorrow because lesson 7 promises to bring everything together so far!

## Projects

### Latin Declension Analyzer (Day 2)
A tool that converts Latin nominative singular nouns/adjectives through all 6 cases across 5 declensions.

**Features:**
- Full case conversion (nom, gen, dat, acc, abl, voc)
- Declension identification
- Syllable counting
- Pattern detection (diphthongs, geminate consonants)
- Interactive phrase analysis

**Tech:** Functions, conditionals, string slicing, nested functions

**Known Limitations:**
- Only handles nominative singular input
- 3rd declension irregulars return placeholder text
- No plural support yet
- Masculine/feminine 4th declension not distinguished
